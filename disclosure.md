# Range Responsible Disclosure Policy

_Effective: May 16, 2017_

_Updated: May 16, 2018_

Data security is a top priority for Range, and Range believes that working with skilled security researchers can identify weaknesses in any technology.

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in Range’s service, please notify us; we will work with you to resolve the issue promptly.

## Disclosure policy

* Let us know as soon as possible when you’ve discovered a potential vulnerability by emailing us at [security@range.co](mailto:security@range.co). We vow to acknowledge your email within 24 hours.
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or a third party. We aim to resolve critical issues within one day of disclosure.
* Make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or interrupting or degrading the Range service. Please only interact with domains you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder.

## Exclusions

While researching, we’d like you to refrain from:

* Denial of service
* Spamming
* Social engineering or phishing of Range employees or contractors
* Any attacks against Range’s physical property or data centers

Thank you for helping to keep Range and our users safe!
