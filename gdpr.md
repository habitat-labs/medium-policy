## Privacy Rights

GDPR is a legal framework that enforces common sense data privacy protections
that we all want. Under these regulations you have a number of important rights
free of charge. In summary, those include rights to:

- Access to your personal data
- Require us to correct any mistakes in your information which we hold
- Require the erasure of personal data concerning you in certain situations
- Object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for direct marketing
- Object in certain other situations to our continued processing of your personal data
- Otherwise restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances
  claim compensation for damages caused by our breach of any data protection laws.

Below is how we address the most important of these rights:

**Informed consent:** Whenever we request personal data from our users, we
explain why we require that data. Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.html)
outlines how we use data.

**Erasure:** When a customer requests to delete all the data provided to us we
delete all the data sources they have provided us.

**Restriction of Processing:** Any user may request to restrict processing of
their data at any time. Once requested, Range will (a) make that person’s
information invisible to other users, and (b) stop processing all information
provided by that user.

**Data portability:** Any customer organization may request to export their data
at any time.

**Rectification:** Any person may request to alter the data about themselves in
Range as long as they verify their identity.

**Access:** Users may request an export of all the personal information we have
about them. This will be provided within 28 days of receipt of the request.

If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please:

- contact us using our contact details below
- let us have enough information to identify you,
- let us know the information to which your request relates.

## Data Processing

In addition to the privacy requirements, GDPR also regulates how we process our
customer’s information. Below is how we address the most important of these
requirements:

**Onward transfer:** In all cases where we transfer personal information to a
3rd party, we ensure that we have GDPR-compliant Data Processor Agreement in
place with those third parties prior to transferring any customer data to them.

**Data Security:** Security is a priority for us. For more information about how
we protect the security of our customer data, as well as our practices regarding
notifications of breaches, you may request a copy of our Information Security
Policies by emailing [feedback@range.co](mailto:feedback@range.co).

**Access:** Users may request an export of all the information we have about
them, as well as all the information we have collected from them. This will be
provided within 28 days of receipt of the request.
