# Range Privacy Policy

_Effective: August 1, 2017_

_Updated: February 28, 2019_

Privacy is important. We respect yours. Our goal is to do more than we have to
by law — we want to earn your trust that we are careful with your data. This
policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how Range Labs Inc. (“Range”,
“us”, “we”) handles the information we collect when you visit and use our sites,
services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”).

### Changes to this policy

Range may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant
changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be
[here](https://github.com/range-labs/range-policy) and we will archive former
versions of the policy as well.

### Who we are

Range provides services to help companies work better together. Our main service
is a team coordination tool for building high-performance cultures. We are a
Delaware C-Corp, located in San Francisco.

### What this policy applies to

This Privacy Policy applies to the range.co website, including all subdomains
and subpages (collectively referred to as the “Site”), and also applies to all
software and services that we offer, including services that we offer through
our Site when you register for a Range account (collectively referred to as the
“Services”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any website, product or service of any
third-party company even if the third-party website links to (or is linked from)
our Site. Range does not operate or control those websites, products or
services. Please always review the privacy practices of a company before
deciding whether to provide any information.

In the event of any inconsistency, our
[Terms of Service](/terms-of-service.html) supersedes this Privacy Policy.

### Data we collect

We collect information about what Range pages you access, information about your
mobile device (such as device or browser type), information you send us (such as
an email address used to register or communicate with us), and referral
information. When you use Range Services, we may collect and store your IP
address.

#### Site visitors

To simply browse our Site, you are not required to provide any Personal
Information. However, we may gather information from cookies and similar
technologies for the purposes of monitoring and improving our Site and
understanding and improving the effectiveness of our advertising.

We use a third-party analytics service, Google Analytics, a service provided by
Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how
users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For
more information on how Google uses this data, go to
[here](www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You may also download the
Google Analytics opt-out browser add on, available
[here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Site users

To gain full access to our Site and Services, you must register for a Range
account. When you register for an account, we collect Personal Information such
as the following:

Your name, business name, location, email address, phone number, and account
password. To set up your account Your IP addresses, devices, and locations used
to access Range, may be linked to your account for security purposes.

When you create a Range account and authenticate via a third-party service, like
Google, we may collect, store, and periodically update profile information
associated with that third-party account. If you choose to authenticate with
other services, during sign up or otherwise, you are giving Range the permission
to use, share, and store associated data in a manner consistent with this
Privacy Notice.

Range partners with Stripe, Inc. for payment processing, and the payment
information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their
policies ([see here](https://stripe.com/us/privacy)). Range doesn’t store your
payment information.

#### Children

Per our Terms of Service, Range is not for children. We do not knowingly collect
Personal Information from children under 13 years of age. If you believe that a
child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at
feedback@range.co. If we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us
with personally identifiable information, we'll delete it.

#### Integrations

When you connect your Range account with a third-party service we may collect
and store information associated with that third-party account and underlying
resources. We make efforts to limit data collection to the minimum required to
provide the service to you.

Please refer to the [integrations help center](https://help.range.co/integrations)
to find up to date information on how each integration works and what data is stored.

### How we use this data

We use your information in the following ways:

- To enable us to provide you with our Services
- To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your
  experience on Range
- To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can understand how Range
  is performing and provide users with the best experience possible
- To send marketing communications (dependent on consent settings)
- To conduct aggregate, non-identifying analysis about how people use Range
  Services
- In the manner described to you at the time of collection or as otherwise
  described in this Privacy Policy

##### Email and mobile notifications

Sometimes we’ll send administrative emails about account or service changes, or
new policies. You can’t opt out of them. You can always opt out of
non-administrative emails such as daily notifications. We won’t email you to ask
for your password or other account information. If you receive such an email,
send it to us so we can investigate.

Other email and mobile notifications are controlled by your account and
organization settings.

### How we disclose data

As a rule, we don’t share your organization’s information outside the company.

We won’t sell your organization’s information.

We may share your organization’s information with third parties in limited
circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a vendor or partner who
meets our data protection standards; or (3) when we have a good faith belief it
is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.

If we’re going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll
give you advance notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court
intervention), unless we’re prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We
will object to requests for information about users of our site that we believe
to be improper.

If we merge with another company such that your information will become subject
to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt
out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.

We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose. For
example, we may share aggregated or de-identified data with prospects or
partners for business or research purposes, such as telling prospective
customers the average number of updates people share per week, or the precentage
of users who access our Services via a mobile device.

##### Customer support

Range partners with Intercom, Inc. (“Intercom”) to provide you with customer
support. Your display name, email, and metadata about your sessions will be
shared with them in accordance with their policies
([see here](https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies)).

### Cookie policy

We use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels and local storage to
recognize you when you return to our Services. We use them in various ways, for
example to log you in, remember your preferences, evaluate email effectiveness,
and personalize information.

Some third-party services that we use, such as Intercom or Google Analytics, may
place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of
cookies by Range only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

### Data storage

Range uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for
hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run
Range.

### Data security

We follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and
maintain, including using Transport Layer Security (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data
transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the
Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at
your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure
your account (like using a strong password).

We encourage the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities of our Services by
emailing [security@range.co](mailto:security@range.co).

### Data retention

We will retain data as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide
you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy. We will also
retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this
Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Range’s legal rights. We also
collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which
we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site,
improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.

To modify or delete the personal information you’ve provided to us, please log
in and update your account. You may also request that your account be deleted by
emailing [support](feedback@range.co). We may retain certain information as
required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.

### Data transfers

Range is a US-based company, and as such your information will be collected and
processed in the United States. The United States has its own laws governing
data protection and government access to information. The rules that protect
your personal information under United States law may be different than in your
home country. If you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms
of Service, which set out the contract between Range and its users.

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we
comply with applicable laws to provide an adequate level of data protection for
the transfer of your Personal Data to the US. Range Labs Inc. is certified under
the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and adheres to the
Privacy Shield Principles. For more, see
