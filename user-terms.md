# User Terms of Service

_Last Updated: December 10, 2018_

Welcome to the Range Labs Inc. (“**Range**”) website located at [range.co](https://www.range.co) (the “**Site**”). If you have been invited to use our Services (defined below) by a Customer (defined below), please read these Terms of Service (the “**User Terms**”) and our [Privacy Policy](https://policy.range.co/privacy-policy.html) (“**Privacy Policy**”) carefully because they govern your use of our Site and our team coordination software accessible via our Site, services, products, content and our desktop and mobile device applications (“**App**”). To make these User Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and App are collectively called the “**Services**,” and the terms “**Range**,” “**we**,” and “**us**” include Range Labs Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries.

**1. Agreement to Terms.** By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these User Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these User Terms, do not use the Services.

**2. Customer Terms.** You have been invited to use and access our Services by an organization or other third party with a subscription to our Services (the “**Customer**”), for example, your employer, university or friend. Customer has separately agreed to our [Customer Terms of Service](https://policy.range.co/terms-of-service.html) or entered into another written agreement (“**Customer Agreement**”) with us for a subscription to our Services.

You acknowledge that your rights to use our Services are subject to the Customer’s rights and obligations under the Customer Agreement to control certain aspects of our Services. For example, Customer may suspend or terminate your account and/or access to the Services, grant or modify your ability to access certain data within the Services (including data that you upload to or post on the Services).

If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the updated User Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the User Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated User Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated User Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the updated User Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
